### This project was made by Adrien Aguila with another student during the 2nd year of our DUT.
#### It uses Symfony framework for PHP and works with a MySQL database (we used [wampserver](https://www.wampserver.com/)).
##### You have to configure your database's infos in the .env file

A list of features is available on the page "..."/about (in french)
